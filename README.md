# Open SwiftUI Apps

## Fully functional and working SwiftUI apps you can modify, extend, and publish to the iOS App Store. 

Each iPhone app is well-crafted with Bitrig and state-of-the-art (SOTA) agentic coding models such as Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2. You're welcome to contribute by creating a new issue or pull request.
